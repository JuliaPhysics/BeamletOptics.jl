    All **coordinate systems** are or must be defined **right-handed**! All normal vectors are or must be defined right-handed! 
    All **rotations** are or must be performed in a **counter-clockwise** manner for a positive rotation angle ``\theta > 0`` and vice-versa!
    For a definition of rotation matrix order, refer to this [article](https://dominicplein.medium.com/extrinsic-intrinsic-rotation-do-i-multiply-from-right-or-left-357c38c1abfd).
