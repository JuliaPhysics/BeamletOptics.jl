  abstract = {A three-by-three polarization ray-tracing matrix method for polarization ray tracing in optical systems is presented for calculating the polarization transformations associated with ray paths through optical systems. The method is a three-dimensional generalization of the Jones calculus. Reflection and refraction algorithms are provided. Diattenuation of the optical system is calculated via singular value decomposition. Two numerical examples, a three fold-mirror system and a hollow corner cube, demonstrate the method.},

  abstract = {The concept of retardance is critically analyzed for ray paths through optical systems described by a three-by-three polarization ray-tracing matrix. Algorithms are presented to separate the effects of retardance from geometric transformations. The geometric transformation described by a ``parallel transport matrix'' characterizes nonpolarizing propagation through an optical system, and also provides a proper relationship between sets of local coordinates along the ray path. The proper retardance is calculated by removing this geometric transformation from the three-by-three polarization ray-tracing matrix. Two rays with different ray paths through an optical system can have the same polarization ray-tracing matrix but different retardances. The retardance and diattenuation of an aluminum-coated three fold-mirror system are analyzed as an example.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that a fundamental Gaussian beam propagating in a lenslike medium with cylindrical symmetry can be generated by the rotation about its axis of a skew ray which obeys the laws of geometrical optics. A complex representation: X(z) $=$ $\xi$(z) $+$ j$\eta$(z), where $\xi$(z) and $\eta$(z) are the projections of the skew ray on two perpendicular meridional planes, is discussed. It is found that the beam radius is equal to the modulus of X(z) and the on-axis phase to the phase of X(z). Using this representation, we derive a general expression for the on-axis phase shift $\Delta$$\Phi$ experienced by a beam with an input complex beam parameter q through an optical system whose ray matrix is \[ABCD\]:$\Delta$$\Phi$$=$phase of(A$+$B/q). When the beam is matched to the optical system (output q $=$ q), $\Delta$$\Phi$ can be written cos--1(A $+$ D)/2. This representation also provides a useful beam tracing method which is demonstrated and a simple interpretation for the known representation of Gaussian modes by ray packets.},

These equations are derived from the ABCD law of Gaussian beam transformation. They can be used in conjunction with a conventional automatic optical design program to design and optimize Gaussian beam optical systems. Several design examples are given using the CODE-V optical design package.},

Formulas are principal given that relate the parameters of the Gaussian beam to the heights and slopes of the paraprincipal rays. Two ray trace examples are provided.},
