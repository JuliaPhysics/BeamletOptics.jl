# Miniature microscope

The UCLA Miniscope is a lightweight microscope that utilizes 2-photon fluorescence imaging to record neural activity in awake, freely moving mice [Madruga:2024](@cite). This beginner tutorial aims to reproduce the optical path of the imaging system from the data provided in the [UCLA 2P Miniscope repository](https://github.com/golshanilab/UCLA_2P_Miniscope). You will learn how to:

1. Define optical components (e.g. a [`SphericalDoubletLens`](@ref))
2. Position the mentioned components using the kinematic API
3. Define an optical [`System`](@ref)
4. Add a source of [`Ray`](@ref)s 
5. Trace a [`Beam`](@ref) through the optical system
6. Visualize the results 

All specifications for the optical system and CAD files are taken from the UCLA miniscope [repository](https://github.com/golshanilab/UCLA_2P_Miniscope) under GNU GPL-3.0.

## How to follow this tutorial

All figures you will see below are pregenerated. The full code and all 3D assets are available in the following files:

```@example miniscope
path = normpath(tutorial_dir) # hide
@info "Files located at:" path # hide
```

If you want to reproduce the plots in this tutorial by yourself, it is recommend that you use the `render!` function as described in the [Visualization](@ref) section. In addition, your simulation script to follow this tutorial should include the following setup code at the start of the file:

```julia
using GLMakie, BeamletOptics

const BMO = BeamletOptics

const cm = 1e-2
const mm = 1e-3
```

## Miniscope objective lenses

This tutorial will focus on modeling the return path of the fluorescence light. Based on the design files provided in the resources above, we will start by defining the first lens along the optical path. This plano-convex lens can be generated via three approaches:

1. Design a [`BeamletOptics.AbstractShape`](@ref) and pass it into the [`Lens`](@ref) type
2. Use the [`SphericalLens`](@ref) convenience constructor
3. Utilize the quasi surface-based [`Lens`](@ref) constructor

Due to its versatility, we will use the latter method in order to reimplement the Zemax design file. It is based on the definition of surface types which will be translated into the correct `AbstractShape` automatically. Refer to the [Surface based lens construction](@ref) section for more information.

### Defining refractive index data

Before we can start, we will need to define refractive indices as a function of the wavelength. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will need to consider the refractive index of the relevant glasses at the design wavelengths. Later on we will define geometrical beams with discrete wavelengths for the ray tracing solver. For the purpose of fluorescence imaging, we will look at $\lambda_{green} = 546.1~\mathrm{nm}$ and $\lambda_{red} = 656.3~\mathrm{nm}$. The indices have been manually taken from the [Schott glass catalog](https://www.schott.com/shop/advanced-optics/en/Optical-Glass/c/optical-glass).

```julia
# Define the design wavelengths
位_green = 546.1e-9
位_red   = 656.3e-9
lambdas = [位_green, 位_red]
# Define ref. indices at the specified wavelengths
NBK7    = DiscreteRefractiveIndex(lambdas, [1.51872, 1.51432])
NSK5    = DiscreteRefractiveIndex(lambdas, [1.59142, 1.58619])
NSF4    = DiscreteRefractiveIndex(lambdas, [1.76164, 1.74719])
NLAK22  = DiscreteRefractiveIndex(lambdas, [1.65391, 1.64760])
NLASF44 = DiscreteRefractiveIndex(lambdas, [1.80832, 1.79901])
```

Note that the tupel ($\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$) is mapped onto ($n_{1}$, $n_{2}$). For more information, refer to the [`DiscreteRefractiveIndex`](@ref) docs.

### Specifying the lens shape

The following code defines the front planar surface and the back spherical convex surface.

```julia
# Objective lens 1
surf_1 = CircularFlatSurface(2*1.144mm)
surf_2 = SphericalSurface(-1.448mm, 2*1.144mm)
obj_lens_1 = Lens(surf_1, surf_2, 1.3mm, NSK5)
```

Note that `obj_lens_1` is a single `Lens` entity once spawned and can be manipulated in 3D-space as described in the section: [Moving optical elements](@ref).

![First objective lens](objective_lens_1.png)

### Building the objective group

To build the second and third lens elements of the objective group we will proceed as above. However, these lenses are spherical doublets formed by two lenses bonded with an optical adhesive. They are also more complex in shape, featuring a mechanical outer diameter. For the second lens the generating code is provided below. Two [`Lens`](@ref)es can be combined into a [`DoubletLens`](@ref). Correct "assembly" of the lens parts is the responsibility of the user.

```julia
# Objective lens 2 - define surfaces
surf_1 = SphericalSurface(38.184mm, 2*1.840mm, 2*2.380mm)
surf_2 = SphericalSurface(3.467mm, 2*2.060mm, 2*2.380mm)
surf_3 = SphericalSurface(-5.020mm, 2*2.380mm)
# Define front and back lens
dl11 = Lens(surf_1, surf_2, 0.5mm, NSF4)
dl12 = Lens(surf_2, surf_3, 2.5mm, NLAK22)
# Move back lens into position
translate3d!(dl12, [0, BMO.thickness(dl11), 0])
# Spawn doublet
obj_lens_2 = DoubletLens(dl11, dl12)
```

The lens parts `dl11` and `dl12` are joined together by moving `dl12` along the y-axis by a distance equal to the on-axis thickness of `dl11`.

![Second objective lens](objective_lens_2.png)

!!! info "Axis conventions"
    In general, most components provided by **BMO** are aligned with the global y-axis and spawned at the origin unless specified otherwise.

Similarily, the third objective lens can be reproduced from the available Zemax data as follows:

```julia
# Tube lens
surf_1 = SphericalSurface(7.744mm, 2*2.812mm, 2*3mm)
surf_2 = SphericalSurface(-3.642mm, 2*3mm)
surf_3 = SphericalSurface(-14.413mm, 2*2.812mm, 2*3mm)
dl21 = Lens(surf_1, surf_2, 3.4mm, NLAK22)
dl22 = Lens(surf_2, surf_3, 1.0mm, NSF4)
translate3d!(dl22, [0, BMO.thickness(dl21), 0])
tube_lens = DoubletLens(dl21, dl22)
```

Assembling the objective group requires that the individual lens elements be translated into position along the optical axis. This is achieved in the code below by taking the current [`BeamletOptics.position`](@ref) of the elements and adding the on-axis `thickness` in addition to the element distancing taken from the specification.

```julia
translate_to3d!(obj_lens_2, [0, BMO.position(obj_lens_1)[2] + BMO.thickness(obj_lens_1) + 3.344mm, 0])
translate_to3d!(tube_lens, [0, BMO.position(obj_lens_2)[2] + BMO.thickness(obj_lens_2) + 2mm, 0])
objective_group = ObjectGroup([obj_lens_1, obj_lens_2, tube_lens])
```

The `objective_group` locks all elements in place with respect to their relative positions and allows for combined translations and rotations of the elements.

### Visualizing the lenses

In order to visualize what we have done so far, we will use `GLMakie` to create a 3D representation of the `BMO` geometry representation. The following code will be used.

```julia
# define rgba for lens look
lens_color() = RGBf(0.678, 0.847, 0.902)
lens_color(alpha) = RGBAf(0.678, 0.847, 0.902, alpha)

# generate figure
fig = Figure(size=(600, 300))
display(fig)
ax = LScene(fig[1,1])
hide_axis(ax)
render!(ax, obj_lens_1, transparency=true, color=lens_color(0.5))
render!(ax, obj_lens_2, transparency=true, color=lens_color(0.5))
render!(ax, tube_lens, transparency=true, color=lens_color(0.5))
```

The generated figure can be seen below. A dashdot line has been added to indicate the global y-axis and lens labels are shown for easier viewing.
