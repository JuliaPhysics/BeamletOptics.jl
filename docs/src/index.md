# BeamletOptics

Building optical setups in a laboratory environment -- for instance a laser interferometer -- is a common task for optical engineers and physicists. This package is intended to provide a simulation environment in which the user can quickly analyze and layout simple optical components like lenses or beamsplitters before committing to a breadboard setup.  

## What is the purpose of this package

This package mainly tries to provide a simple Gaussian beamlet propagation tool for coherent, monochromatic and directed light sources. It also offers a convenient kinematic API that allows for the easy placing of optical elements and straight-forward simulation of moving or vibrating components. 

For this purpose, the package implements a traditional ray tracing solver. This forms the backbone of the Gaussian beamlet tracing scheme that has been implemented to model the propagation of laser beams.

!!! info "What this package is not"
    This package does not include tools for optimizing optical systems, such as fine-tuning lens surfaces to minimize specific aberrations in multi-lens setups. Instead, the package is designed as a digital laboratory where you can play around with stuff before buying it.

### Installation

!!! warning
    This package requires Julia â‰¥ 1.9.4

You can add this package to your project by entering the package manager (press `]` in the REPL) and typing `add BeamletOptics`. It is also recommended that you `add GLMakie`. You can include this package into your current scope via `using BeamletOptics`. If a Makie version is loaded before or after the inclusion of this package, the extension provided as part of this package will enable additional visualization functions.
