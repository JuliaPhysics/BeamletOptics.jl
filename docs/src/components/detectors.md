# Detectors

Detectors provide a way to evaluate beam data during optical simulations. They are designed to accumulate e.g. field data, enabling analysis of intensity distributions, interference patterns, and other beam properties.

Detectors are supposed to fall under the [`SCDI.AbstractDetector`](@ref) type, which defines a interface for detector implementations.

!!! warning "Resetting detectors"
    In general, the data stored in a detector is not automatically reset between calls of [`SCDI.solve_system!`](@ref). This task is placed within the responsibility of the user. A detector reset can be performed with the [`SCDI.reset_detector!`](@ref) function.

## Photodetector

A concrete implementation to "measure" intensity distributions generated by a [`SCDI.GaussianBeamlet`](@ref) is provided in the form of the [`SCDI.Photodetector`](@ref):

```@docs; canonical=false
SCDI.Photodetector
```

```@eval
asset_dir = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "assets")

Base.include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(asset_dir, "photodetector_showcase.jl"))

save("fringes_showcase.png", fringes_fig, px_per_unit=4)
save("pd_showcase.png", detector_fig, px_per_unit=4)

nothing
```

The `interact3d` model of the [`SCDI.Photodetector`](@ref) can store complex electric field (E-field) values from intersecting [`SCDI.GaussianBeamlet`](@ref)s, enabling the reconstruction of spatial intensity distribution across its active surface. This data can be used to calculate e.g. beam interference patterns via the [`SCDI.intensity`](@ref) function. The [`SCDI.optical_power`](@ref) method can be used in order to obtain the total optical power at the detector. Below a rendered example of a detector model ([FDS010](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FDS010)) can be seen. The detector active area is marked in blue (1x1 mmÂ²).

One of the use cases of the [`SCDI.Photodetector`](@ref) is to analyse interference patterns. The figure below demonstrates an example intensity distribution captured by the detector pictured above, showing radial fringes due to a mismatch of the radii of curvature of the interfering [`SCDI.GaussianBeamlet`](@ref)s.

!!! info "Interferometer tutorial"
    Refer to the [Michelson interferometer](@ref) section for a detailed tutorial on how to use the [`SCDI.Photodetector`](@ref).

## Spotdetector

A straight forward detector that stores the [`SCDI.Intersection`](@ref) position of an incoming [`SCDI.Beam`](@ref). This device can be used to generate spot diagrams, which are commonly used to perform initial assessments of the optical performance of an imaging setup.

```@docs; canonical=false
SCDI.Spotdetector
```

```@eval
asset_dir = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "assets")

Base.include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(asset_dir, "spotdetector_showcase.jl"))

save("spot_diagram_system.png", system_fig, px_per_unit=4)
save("spot_diagram_showcase.png", spot_fig, px_per_unit=4)

nothing
```

Below an optical system consisting of a collection of collimated [`SCDI.Beam`](@ref)s passing through a [`SCDI.ThinLens`](@ref) is shown. A [`SCDI.Spotdetector`](@ref) is positioned at the approximate focal plane to capture the resulting spot diagram.

![Thin lens setup](spot_diagram_system.png)

The beam bundle used to generate the spot diagram was created via the [`SCDI.create_spot_diagram`](@ref) function, which is a trivial way to retrace a single beam through an on-axis system. The resulting spot diagram of the lens shown above is visualized below.
