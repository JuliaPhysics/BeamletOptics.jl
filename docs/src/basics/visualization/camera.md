# Scene and camera helpers

Alongside `render!`, a small set of `LScene`-specific helpers is provided for framing and
annotating a 3D scene once a backend is loaded: [`get_view`](@ref), [`set_view`](@ref),
[`set_orthographic`](@ref), [`hide_axis`](@ref), [`look_at!`](@ref), [`arrow!`](@ref) and
[`render_lcs!`](@ref). Like `render!`, each throws a
[`BeamletOptics.MissingBackendError`](@ref) if called before a suitable backend has been
loaded. Refer to the **Reference** page for their full docstrings.

The `get_view`/`set_view(ls, matrix)` pair is meant for interactive use: rotate the scene
by hand, call `get_view(ax)`, and paste the printed matrix back into the script as a
literal passed to `set_view`. This is the pattern used throughout this package's own
tutorials to freeze a camera position found interactively. The `set_view(ls, eye, lookat,
up)` and `look_at!` forms are the reproducible alternative, useful when the viewpoint
should be derived from the scene's own geometry instead of copy-pasted.

!!! note
    These helpers need an `LScene`. They do not work with an `Axis3`.
