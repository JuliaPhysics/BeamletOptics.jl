# Visualization

As mentioned in other sections of this documentation, the [Makie](https://docs.makie.org) backend can be used in order to generate 2D/3D renderings of optical systems and results generated with this package. Refer to the extensive `Makie` documentation and the **Examples** and the **Tutorials** sections of this package for a variety of showcases on how to visualize your simulation.

## Rendering elements

The main function provided for visualization purposes is the [`render!`](@ref) function. 

```@docs; canonical=false
render!(::Any, ::BeamletOptics._RenderTypes)
```

If a suitable backend is loaded, additional dispatched `render!` functions will become available. For instance, this allows the plotting of a [`GaussianBeamlet`](@ref).

## Loading the extension

Refer to the following snippet for an example on how the extension loading behaves. When only BMO is loaded, the `render!` function becomes available but will throw an [`BeamletOptics.MissingBackendError`](@ref) when trying to plot something.

```julia
julia> using BeamletOptics

julia> methods(render!)
# 1 method for generic function "render!" from BeamletOptics:
 [1] render!(::Any, ::Union{BeamletOptics.AbstractSystem, BeamletOptics.AbstractBeam, BeamletOptics.AbstractObject, BeamletOptics.AbstractObjectGroup, BeamletOptics.AbstractRay, BeamletOptics.AbstractShape}, kwargs...)
     @ C:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\src\Render.jl:56

julia> axis = nothing;

julia> mirror = RoundPlanoMirror(25e-3, 5e-3);

julia> render!(axis, mirror)
ERROR: It appears no suitable Makie backend is loaded in this session.
Stacktrace:
 [1] render!(::Nothing, ::RoundPlanoMirror{Float64})
   @ BeamletOptics c:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\src\Render.jl:46
 [2] top-level scope
   @ REPL[5]:1
```

Once a backend has been loaded, additional dispatched versions of `render!` become available.

```julia
julia> using GLMakie

julia> methods(render!)
# 21 methods for generic function "render!" from BeamletOptics:
  [1] render!(ax::Union{Axis3, LScene}, s::BeamletOptics.UnionSDF; kwargs...)
     @ BeamletOpticsMakieExt C:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\ext\RenderSDF.jl:32
  [2] render!(axis::Union{Axis3, LScene}, css::BeamletOptics.ConcaveSphericalSurfaceSDF; color, kwargs...)
     @ BeamletOpticsMakieExt C:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\ext\RenderLenses.jl:1
  [3] render!(axis::Union{Axis3, LScene}, css::BeamletOptics.ConvexSphericalSurfaceSDF; color, kwargs...)
     @ BeamletOpticsMakieExt C:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\ext\RenderLenses.jl:31
  [4] render!(axis::Union{Axis3, LScene}, acyl::BeamletOptics.AbstractAcylindricalSurfaceSDF; color, kwargs...)
     @ BeamletOpticsMakieExt C:\Users\anon\.julia\dev\BeamletOptics\ext\RenderCylinderLenses.jl:1
  [5] etc...
```

## Camera and scene helpers

Alongside `render!`, a small set of `LScene`-specific helpers is provided for framing and
annotating a 3D scene once a backend is loaded: [`get_view`](@ref), [`set_view`](@ref),
[`set_orthographic`](@ref), [`hide_axis`](@ref), [`look_at!`](@ref), [`arrow!`](@ref) and
[`render_lcs!`](@ref). Like `render!`, each throws a
[`BeamletOptics.MissingBackendError`](@ref) if called before a suitable backend has been
loaded. Refer to the **Reference** page for their full docstrings.

The `get_view`/`set_view(ls, matrix)` pair is meant for interactive use: rotate the scene
by hand, call `get_view(ax)`, and paste the printed matrix back into the script as a
literal passed to `set_view`. This is the pattern used throughout this package's own
tutorials to freeze a camera position found interactively. The `set_view(ls, eye, lookat,
up)` and `look_at!` forms are the reproducible alternative, useful when the viewpoint
should be derived from the scene's own geometry instead of copy-pasted.
## Live rendering

`render!` generates new plots on every call. For animations and interactive applications, where
components are moved and the system is re-solved many times per second, use
[`live_render!`](@ref) instead. It returns a handle that re-synchronizes the existing plots with
the current simulation state via [`update_render!`](@ref):

```julia
using GLMakie, BeamletOptics

fig = Figure()
ax = LScene(fig[1, 1])

hsys = live_render!(ax, system)   # geometry is generated once
hbeam = live_render!(ax, beam)    # all ray segments bundled into a single plot

zrotate3d!(mirror, 1e-3)
solve_system!(system, beam)
update_render!(hsys)              # moved components: only their model transformation changes
update_render!(hbeam)             # beam path: point buffer is replaced in place
```

- **Objects and systems**: the geometry is rendered once with `render!`. Kinematic changes
  (`translate3d!`, `rotate3d!`, ...) are then applied as a rigid model transformation of the
  existing plots, which costs microseconds regardless of the mesh resolution.
- **Rays, beams and beam groups**: all segments are drawn by a single `linesegments` plot, so the
  number of plots does not grow with the number of rays. The number of segments may change
  between updates, e.g. when a component is moved out of the beam path.
- **Gaussian beamlets**: the 1/e² envelope of all segments is merged into a single mesh.
  `AstigmaticGaussianBeamlet`s are not supported yet.

Use [`remove_render!`](@ref) to delete the plots of a handle.

## Interactive kinematics

With [`kinematic_controls!`](@ref), the components of a live-rendered system can be grabbed and
moved with the mouse. The `on_change` callback is invoked (at most once per frame) after every
change and is the place to re-solve the system and update dependent plots:

```julia
ctrl = kinematic_controls!(ax, hsys; on_change = obj -> begin
    empty!(detector)
    solve_system!(system, beam)
    update_render!(hbeam)
end)
```

| Input                              | Effect                                                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Left-drag on a component           | Move it in the horizontal plane (`plane_normal`)           |
| Shift + left-drag on a component   | Rotate it about the vertical axis (`rotation_axis`)        |
| `↑` / `↓`                          | Fine translation along the component normal (`fine_step`)  |
| `←` / `→`                          | Fine rotation about `rotation_axis` (`fine_angle`)         |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down`            | Fine tilt about the component's local x-axis               |
| Shift + key                        | ×10 step size                                              |
| `r`                                | Reset the selected component to its initial pose           |
| `Esc` / click on empty space       | Deselect                                                   |
| `h`                                | Show or hide an overlay of all controls                    |

The selected component is marked by a box and three arrows, which show the direction of `↑` (green), the tilt axis of `Page Up` (red) and the rotation axis of `←` (blue). The camera works as usual as long as no component is grabbed. Call `close(ctrl)` to remove the
controls.

A complete example can be found in the [Interactive Michelson interferometer](@ref) example.
