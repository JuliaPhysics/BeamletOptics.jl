"""
    RectangularCompensatorPlate(width, height, thickness, n)

Creates a compensator plate (modeled as a [`Prism`](@ref)) that can be used to remove
parallel beam offsets created by e.g. the [`RectangularPlateBeamsplitter`](@ref).
The compensator is aligned with the positive y-axis. The first surface lies at the origin.

# Inputs

- `width`: compensator width along the x-axis in [m]
- `height`: compensator height along the z-axis in [m]
- `thickness`: compensator thickness along the y-axis in [m]
- `n`: the [`RefractiveIndex`](@ref) of the substrate
